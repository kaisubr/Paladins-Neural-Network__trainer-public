### Git LFS
You may clone this repository with `git clone`. If large files don't clone, try `git lfs clone`. Recall that in Google Colab, you'll need to use `!`.
To push, you need to have [LFS](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/versioning-large-files) installed. Then, run 

```
git lfs track "*.tar.gz"
git lfs track "*.ckpt-*"
```
